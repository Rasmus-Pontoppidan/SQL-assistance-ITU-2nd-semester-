SELECT <components> // * = everything
FROM component    // From one specific table
[WHERE component] // What table rows to be selected. Can take comparators, booleans, "BETWEEN / AND", "IN", "LIKE", and NULL
                  // multiple conditions allowed with "AND" command.
[GROUP BY component] // Rows are grouped when one or more columns have same value. Aggregation applied to each group separately.

Join Queries: //merging rows from different tables

SELECT <components>
FROM <table1>, <table2>, <table n>  //prevent ambiguity by <table1>.<attribute>
WHERE <condition>
AND <condition>   //optional

OR

SELECT <components>               //Inner join
FROM <table1> AS <X> INNER JOIN SUPPLIES AS <Y>
ON (X.<attribute> = Y.<attribute>)

SELECT Outer.<components>, joined.<components>     // Left outer join. Each row from left table is kept.
FROM <table> AS Outer LEFT OUTER JOIN SUPPLIES AS Joined
ON (R.<attribute> = S.<attribute>)

// Right outer join does the opposite
// Full outer join keeps both table's rows in full
